Angela Duffy, president of Duffy Company, has instructed Jana Barth, the head of the accounting department for Duffy Company, to report the company's land in the company's accounting reports at its fair value of $170,000 instead of its cost of $100,000. Duffy says, “Showing the land at $170,000 will make our company look like a better investment when we try to attract new investors next month.”
