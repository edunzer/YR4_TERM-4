## CHAPTER 1 QUESTION 1

Accounting is an information system that identifies, records, and communicates the economic events of an organization to interested users. Accounting systems focus on business transactions – economic events that have an impact on one or more component of the accounting formula. Many other events take place that can significantly impact a business, even if they do not directly impact the accounting formula. Is accounting’s focus on economic transactions a strength or a weakness?

- I think it depends on the scenario but if we are talking about knowledge of a company then I think its singular focus on only the economic transactions can be a weakness. In many instances businesses have more to offer then just there balance sheet and since accounting would not be able to see those there view of the business could be incorrect.

In other instances where unimportant factors come into play like peoples feelings using a purely accounting perspective could be beneficial. This would allow major decisions to only revolve around the monetary values that the company has instead of other factors that are not important to the company. A prime example is when a business needs to fire sales employees because there payroll is too high. Accounts could go through the returns per employee and figure out who is making the company the most money and who is not.
