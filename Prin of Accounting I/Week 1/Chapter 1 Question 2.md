## CHAPTER 1 QUESTION 2

 ACC 201 Principles of Accounting I Assets are defined as resources that are owned by a business and that possess the capacity to provide future service or benefits. Businesses, especially e-businesses, often collect data about their customers, the individuals and organizations with which they do business. Is customer information an asset which should be reported in the financial statements?

 - This again depends on the scenario. If the business in question uses that customer information for any means that make them money or could make them money in the future then it is a asset. If the information is actively making them money at that moment and can be reflected in a financial statement then yes it should be reported as a asset to that company/business. More over the most important thing about this type of asset is if it has an economic value. Currently personal data is a valued item between advertising and marketing agencies and therefore has value, but if in the future selling data like this becomes illegal for some reason then its value could change.
