## CHAPTER 5 QUESTION 2

How does the single-step form of the income statement differ from the multiple-step form?

Multi step uses a three step method to calculate net income and makes sure to separate operational revenue from non-operational revenue. Obviously multi step is more detailed and show more information including gross profits which can gauge efficiency.
