## CHAPTER 5 QUESTION 1

Income from operations represents the results of a company’s normal operations. Many analysts consider operating income to be even more important than net income. Which income number – operating income or net income – do you consider more important? Why?

- When looking at the company as a whole net income is the most important income number but when looking at individual returns that the company is producing then operating income becomes more important. Net income can contain additional income sources outside of the basic sale of assets which can create a false image of a company and its returns.
