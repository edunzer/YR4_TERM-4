## CHAPTER 7 QUESTION 1

 Accounting information systems capture transaction data, often through the use of source documents â€“ some paper-based, some electronic. The design of a source document can impact how easily and accurately it is used. For example, when user name is captured, it should be clear to document users whether they should enter their first name first or their last name first. When a date is required, a computerized system can utilize the current system date. Describe one or more source document design issues that could impact how easily and accurately the document would be used.

 - As stated in the question formatting is a huge part of any document that is constantly produced or more likely a database that has constant data exchange. Making sure that values are set to a certain type and more likely only allowed as a certain type is a highly important part of constant data input. A possible problem/design issue when looking at source documents is how to format checks, invoices, receipts, etc. that are entered into the system. For example if certain information is required in the source document for the company but not provided in the original receipt what needs to take place?
