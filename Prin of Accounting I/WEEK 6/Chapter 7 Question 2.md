## CHAPTER 7 QUESTION 2

The development of an accounting system involves four phases: analysis, design, implementation, and follow-up. How could an accountant participate in and contribute to each step of the process?

- In order to contribute to each of the 4 phases an accountant would first have to plan and identify the information needs and where that information is coming from. This also related to our previous discussion question about formatting source documents. Next would be creating forms, documents, procedures, and reports that work with those information needs and sources. After doing both of the first 2 steps the planning is complete and next will be implementing the system that has been created for the organization that is being reviewed. Lastly the accountant in question should maintain a close watch over the created system looking for errors and checking and updating the system when needs change.
