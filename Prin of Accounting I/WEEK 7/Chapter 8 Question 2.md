## CHAPTER 8 QUESTION 2

Organizations have long used cameras to monitor employees' activities. Now, computer software can monitor employees’ use of their computer (for example, tracking what websites they visit), often without the employees’ knowledge. In your opinion, is such monitoring an appropriate component of internal control?

- I think this is absolutely an appropriate component of business to manage there control over employees. If all monitoring is done through company resources, and on company devices it is there property along with there employees working during proper hours. This also enables correct assumptions and data relating to employees work.

For example in hourly wage jobs having accurate monitoring could help identify workers that do not work during all times of the day and therefore are receiving payment in exchange for no work. Many hourly pay jobs encourage workers to take longer on tasks that could be done in less time and more efficiently but instead they take longer because they want more money. Monitoring the employees more carefully could give the company more internal control.
