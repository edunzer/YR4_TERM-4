## CHAPTER 11 QUESTION 1

As a general rule, retailers are required to collect sales tax from their customers and remit it to the proper taxing authorities. Sales prices on items are usually presented at a before-tax amount. What are the advantages and disadvantages â€“ to the customer and business -- of such an approach? What would be the advantages and disadvantages of presenting prices that already have the tax amount included?

- Obviously presenting a price without the taxes included is more favorable to the business since the customer will be more inclined to buy an item that is cheaper. But a potential negative is that the customer would be turned off after paying and seeing the added amount of tax on there bill. The greater disadvantage is that the business as to deal with more accounting when totaling there sales and then the tax requirements on those sales.

Now on the flip side including tax with the item would make total sales accounting much easier for the business and could save a lot of time, but in some circumstances prices could seem inflated and the value calculations might need adjusting. For customer seeing a higher price could either mean that they are less likely to purchase the product or that they might like that they are seeing the actual price that they will be paying now instead of after checkout.
