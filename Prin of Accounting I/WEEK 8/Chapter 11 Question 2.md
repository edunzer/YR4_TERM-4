## CHAPTER 11 QUESTION 2

The Teachers Union in Tegra County is at odds with the local school board. The union claims that Tegra’s teachers’ salaries make them the lowest paid teachers in the state. The board claims that their compensation package makes them the second highest paid teachers in the state. Can the union and the board both be correct?

- Yes they could both be correct in a broad sense. If the union is only looking at direct wages; whether that is hourly or salaries then they could be forgetting about other incentives like health insurance, pension plans, etc. that could actually be better then some teachers in the state. The best alternative to this scenario is to take everything into account and make sure that other teachers in the state are compared similarly.
