## CHAPTER 4 QUESTION 1

External users generally depend on the financial statements prepared and published by an organization to provide the information they need for decision-making. The Internet and database technology make it possible for an organization to allow external users to have access to detailed transaction data on an ongoing basis. What are the advantages and disadvantages of such an arrangement to external users and the organization?

The main disadvantage of showing external users your business financial reports is that any problems, liabilities, unsafe investments, etc. that have happened can be viewed and therefore judged by those users. This can create negative images of your organization along with halt transactions between partners and companies that you do business with. If this were a publicly traded company that also has concerns about "image" then these financial statements could also effect how people view and trade your business.

On the flip side showing financial to external users can do the opposite of everything stated above if you have documents that support the views and wants of those users and businesses. This could go a long way with your "image" as a business since you are showing that there is nothing to hide and that you want to be open with the users that support your business.

Also as another disadvantage for publicly traded companies possible undisclosed results, reports, information, etc. about proprietary business product could be inferred and discovered in these financial documents. An example could be that a business makes a large purchase of another companies stock and this information was discovered before an announcement making the information public.
