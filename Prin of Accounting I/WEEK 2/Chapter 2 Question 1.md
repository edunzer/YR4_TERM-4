## CHAPTER 2 QUESTION 1

 Increasingly automated accounting systems allow users to capture transaction data and then generate reports and financial statements. The processing of transaction data takes place behind the scenes. Do all users of accounting systems need to understand how accounting systems work? If not all users, then which users?

 - Certainly not all users of a automated system "need" to understand the system and what is going on. There could be many instances where all a person needs is data after the system has calculated something. The need for understanding of the accounting process comes into play when someone needs to edit this system, or change values that the system uses. Then a user would need to know the accounting process. Much like any automated system no one "needs" know the process until it breaks or needs to be changed.

 Now on the other hand "should" all users have knowledge of the accounting system when using this automated system? From personal business experience I think they should in order to prevent false data and possible issues that are created by the automated system.
