## CHAPTER 2 QUESTION 2

A friend of yours who is trying to help you with your accounting class tells you debit balances are good and credit balances are bad.  Are they correct? Discuss.

- No the friend is not correct.

Debits increase asset, expense, and dividend accounts, while credits decrease them.

Credits increase liability, revenue, and equity accounts, while debits decrease them.

Neither is bad or good its supposed to be seen in terms of balance between the two and that is where good or bad comes into play.
