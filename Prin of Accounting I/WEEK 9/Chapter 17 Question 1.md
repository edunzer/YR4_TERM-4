## CHAPTER 17 QUESTION 1

Is the cash flow statement prepared using accrual accounting or cash accounting?

- Accrual accounting is where revenues and expenses are noted when they are exchanged even though the cash is not physically in hand.

- Cash accounting only sees cash when it has been fully exchanged and the money is in hand on either end of the transaction. This type does not recognize receivables or payables.

- A cash flow statement consists of a summarization of the amount of cash and equivalent cash items entering and leaving a company. Therefore Accrual accounting is the method that would used for preparing a cash flow statement.
