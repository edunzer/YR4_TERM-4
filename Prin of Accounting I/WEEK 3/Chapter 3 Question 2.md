## CHAPTER 3 QUESTION 2

You are an experienced accountant assigned to train a student who is in interning with your organization. He/She tells you that he/she learned about adjusting journal entries in his/her principles of accounting class. He/She also tells you that he/she never figured out which adjustment(s) is the most important one(s) to make at the end of an accounting period. How would you respond to the intern's comment?

- It fairly obvious that the intern is wrong and that if you only make some adjustments over others then you will have incorrect figures in that accounting period.
