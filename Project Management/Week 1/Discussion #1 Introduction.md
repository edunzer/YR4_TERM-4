## DISCUSSION #1 INTRODCUTION

Hi my name is Ethan. I am a junior at Oregon tech, and I am studying Information and Technology. This means that I will be going into the tech field; more specifically Web marketing, email marketing, and Web development.

As far as information about me, I grew up in Lake Oswego (Portland) and moved to Bend 4 years ago then just recently moved back into the Portland area. I am currently on a full class load but am actively looking for jobs and internships to start my career.

You can probably guess that I like computers based on my major but I also like working on my car, cooking, and home improvement projects.
