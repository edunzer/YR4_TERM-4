## DISCUSSION #6 RESOURCE LEVELING

Your the project manager for a website dev; there is a resource conflict between two activities. The resource is a person that is working. How will that resource be managed and broken up between projects?

- So for web dev a simple scenario like this would be implementing two new pages on the website. Both would require this shared resource/employee and would most likely be doing similar setup/work for both of these projects.  

- First I would make sure that all project goals are defined for both projects, along with there requirements

- Then I would label the tasks that the shared resource employee would have to do on both of those projects.

- This would enable me to see what is going to be required of this employee and how it will effect the projects progression.

- Then by making a network diagram of both projects I would be able to see the tasks that the employee would have to do in order to keep both projects running at the same time in the similar time frame.
