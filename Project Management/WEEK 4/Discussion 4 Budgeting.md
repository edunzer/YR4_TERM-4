## DISCUSSION 4 BUDGETING

So as stated in both previous videos for this discussion contingencies are a great way to mediate the potential risks that are involved in projects. I think over estimating a small amount in any project scenario would be a great idea incase something comes up, but its needs to be small.

The larger that estimation gets the more risks you will have whether that is on the client side or your own side. I can certainly think of many different scenarios where workers would see that they have extra time allotted on the project and therefore not work at the rate they should be.

As Jennifer stated its good to be open with your clients about the risk but when you go to far that client could have negatives feelings about the timeline. Contractors being famous for this style of project management.
