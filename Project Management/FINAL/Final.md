Question 1
Not yet graded / 20 pts


Congratulation! You have just been selected to manage the next OIT international dinner. As the acting PM, what should you expect your responsibilities to include? You will also have a significant say in what team members are selected for the project. Name at least 3 characteristics and/or skills you should be looking for in prospective team members from our learning this term.



Your Answer:
What should you expect your responsibilities to include?

- PM's are in charge of the planning and development of a project. They need to create teams, timelines, and set deadlines. They also need to be able to manage issues/problems and money within the projects.

Name at least 3 characteristics and/or skills you should be looking for in prospective team members from our learning this term.

- Well since the PM will have an outlined plan of action for a project they are most likely looking for members that fit into that mold. For the "international dinner" example the PM would be looking for cooking skills, international knowledge, and then catering or dinning knowledge.


Question 2

Before you get straight to work, you decide a Project Charter is in order. What should be included in the charter? Give an example specific to this project (no more than one sentence) of each item you choose to include.

Your Answer:
What should be included in the charter?

- This charter would need to first have the reasoning for the project. So why there is an international dinner at OIT and what is the purpose of it. Then there will be the objects of this project, like bringing the different cultures together with all there food or exposing students to different cultures. And exactly how this will be achieved. Next there would be the overview of the budget and project costs and figures that would go with all the objectives and wants of the project.


Question 3

Among other things, a project manager is expected to manage the iron triangle. What does this mean? Give at least one example of a tradeoff between corners of the triangle, as it may relate to the international dinner.


Your Answer:
What does this mean?

- The iron triangle is the three main constraints of any project, scope, cost, and then time. All of these can effect the quality of the project in its entirety. Managing the iron triangle means that you have to balance the different aspects of the triangle to fit your needs. For example if you have to have a low cost then this could have effects on the scope and time of the project.

Give at least one example of a tradeoff between corners of the triangle, as it may relate to the international dinner.

- In the example "international dinner" a possible tradeoff would be the scope for the cost. Since the budget of the project is probably not healthy enough to support a lavish meal of every cultures foods it most likely will have to diminish the scope of the project to something more reasonable.


Question 4

You break down the work that needs to be accomplished for the dinner in the following structure.

What should you call this initial plan?
Which activity should be identified as 2.3 in this case?
How many level 2 activities are identified on this WBS?
Can any activities as a predecessor to another task from a WBS like this?
WBS

Your Answer:
What should you call this initial plan?

-This would be called a WBS diagram. It is a visual hierarchy based diagram that details the elements of a project.

Which activity should be identified as 2.3 in this case?

- Plan Dessert assuming that food is 2.0

How many level 2 activities are identified on this WBS?

- 9

Can any activities as a predecessor to another task from a WBS like this?

- Uh I don't think the phrasing of this question is correct.

Network Diagram


Your Answer:
Identify the critical path.

- A, B H, C

Assuming the durations are given in days, how long will it take to complete the project?

- 27 days

What is the latest start time for activity H?

- 21 days

How much slack time do you have to plan the dinner (activity D)?

-19 days


Question 6

You decide to put your plan into Microsoft Project for easier management. The following is a screenshot of your WBS and Gantt chart.

When should the project be complete based on the initial plan?
Describe crashing. Which activities are prime candidates for crashing?
Describe fast tracking. Which activities are prime candidates for fast tracking?
Gantt

Your Answer:
When should the project be complete based on the initial plan?

- 7/12/17

Describe crashing. Which activities are prime candidates for crashing

- crashing is where you add more resources so that you can change the timeline without changing the scope of the project. H performances and b-furnishing are both the longest activities with no slack so they need to be finished on time. They would both benefit from a crash approach.

Describe fast tracking. Which activities are prime candidates for fast tracking?

- Fast tracking is where you put tasks in parallel so that they work better with the timeline and will help alleviate wasted time. They are basically worked on at the same time instead of independently.


Question 7

As the project progresses, you suddenly realize that Sally Joe is required to select keynote speakers (i) as well as performances (h). She is required for both. No one else can replace her, and both activities cannot be done at the same time. You decide to level the resource.

Which activity should be completed first? How did you decide?
How (if at all) has the expected duration of the project changed due to this resource conflict?


Network Diagram

Your Answer:
Which activity should be completed first? How did you decide?

- H will go first because it takes the longest and is on the critical path. Then I will follow after it is finished.

How (if at all) has the expected duration of the project changed due to this resource conflict?

- The duration has increase to 34 days from 27


Question 8
Not yet graded / 20 pts
2 weeks prior to the international dinner, you decide to compare your budget against actual expenditures. By this point in the project, you anticipated spending $4100. You have earned $3750 in project progress and spent $3490 to do so.

1) Identify the cost and schedule variance amounts

2) Calculate the CPI and SPI for the project

2) Are ahead or behind schedule?

3) Are you over or under budget?

Your Answer:
Identify the cost and schedule variance amounts

- Cost Variance = 3750 - 3490 = 260

- Schedule Variance = 4100 - 3490 = 610

Calculate the CPI and SPI for the project

- CPI = 4100 / 3750 = 1.093

- SPI = 4100 / 3490 = 1.17

Are ahead or behind schedule?

The value is over 1 so its ahead

Are you over or under budget?

It has cost 260 less then what was planned for so under budget


Question 9
Not yet graded / 20 pts
Several months before the dinner (and consequently, just before the majority of expenditures), some executives begin to question the value of the international dinner. The dinner costs the school $5300 and research has shown the cashflow payback of events like this to be as little as $1400 per year, over the following 5 years. Oregon Tech analyzes projects based on a 5 year payback period, and assumes an average hurdle rate of 10%.

Calculate the NPV for the international dinner. Are the executives correct? Is the school's money better spent elsewhere? Defend.

What other (indirect, or non-monetary) considerations should be weighed in defending the value of this project?

Your Answer:
Calculate the NPV for the international dinner.

1400 / (1 + .10) * 5 = 6363.63

Are the executives correct? Is the school's money better spent elsewhere? Defend.

- Well the NPV shows that the money earned from this dinner over a 5 year period will increase in its value above the original amount spent on the dinner. So no the executives are not correct that the money is wasted.

What other (indirect, or non-monetary) considerations should be weighed in defending the value of this project?

- Personal view points of outside potential clients would be a large factor. Having this dinner could make people more likely to register at OIT and therefore increase the amount of money coming into the school.


Question 10
Not yet graded / 20 pts
We learned early in the term that projects usually follow one of two life-cycles: S or J curve. Which of these two life-cycles would you expect this project to follow? Give two reasons that it is important to identify the life-cycle early in the project.

Your Answer:
Which of these two life-cycles would you expect this project to follow?

- I would classify this project as a J curve since there is a large investment amount upfront that commits the project to negative returns but then after some time it starts to see a steady rate of return for a long period of time.

Give two reasons that it is important to identify the life-cycle early in the project.

- Planning and execution. If you want to end up a certain way in a certain amount of time then the execution of the project needs to happen early on so that you can change the planning of it more effectively.
