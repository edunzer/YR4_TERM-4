`diversity in there knowledge `

Hi guys for this discussion I thought that group members should be diverse in there knowledge which relates to that first factor that was outlined in chapter. By this I mean each member should have different backgrounds and those backgrounds gave them different knowledge. Having people that all have the same background and knowledge can really limit the possibilities for a project that are you are trying to complete. Ideas are often the same and you don't get any of those out of the box ideas that people with different knowledge might have.

This is extremely important in my career field, which is the tech marketing area, where most people have a marketing degree or a business degree and they often don't think about other problems that someone with a CS degree might think of.
