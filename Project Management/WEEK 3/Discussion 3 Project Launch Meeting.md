## DISCUSSION 3 PROJECT LAUNCH MEETING

What are 3 ground rules for a team that would be working on a project together?

Although I do understand the basic idea of supporting a group members thoughts by only saying "yes and" or only being able to further that thought I do think this can halt idea creation. A lot of the time this structured way of thinking is good for a project when a concrete main idea has been thought of and your only working on supporting aspects of that project. But for the main idea creation of a project this style often stifles peoples thoughts on others ideas and whether or not they would work.

So for my rules I would focus more on preparedness, i.e. everyone should come prepared with ideas and thoughts even if you don't end of using them.

Then when there is a large change in thought process it needs to be shared with everyone and discussed to make sure everyone is on the same page.

And lastly make sure that your concerns are heard and are explained but know when to stop forcing an issue. It is important to always share your opinion but doing it all the time and constantly stopping the progress of a discussion with it can effect the group dynamic.
