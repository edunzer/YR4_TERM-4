## DISCUSSION #8 AUDIT CONTROL

As a Project Manager what would your pitch be to your team members? And as an auditor what would you say to the team that you are auditing?

- As a PM it is important to suggest the possibilities to your team on what the audit will entail. Bringing up possible questions could really help the team feel more prepared and comfortable. Also suggest to them to have all there work organized and ready to present and show off to the auditor so that this process can move quickly and effectively.

- As an auditor you need to complete your work just like everyone else, so it is important to let everyone know your plan of action and how you are going to go through the project audit process. This will help the employees know what to expect along with just helping the process along. For most people an audit is not something to be excited about so making sure everyone is as comfortable as possible will make the review a lot easier.
