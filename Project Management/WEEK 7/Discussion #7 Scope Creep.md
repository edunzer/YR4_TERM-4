## DISCUSSION #7 SCOPE CREEP

How would you manage a client approaching you about a small new feature that will be added to the project.

- Since in this perspective you are working for the client it is important to note that you need to do what the client asks. Now this situation is assuming that the project is already planned out and thought out so if you are hesitant about adding another feature you need to explain why and give the client the option to no add this feature.
