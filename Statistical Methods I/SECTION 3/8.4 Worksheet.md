We fit the regression of Weight on Wrist (with weight as the explanatory variable).
The following results were obtained:


Model Coefficients - WRIST
Predictor	Estimate	SE	t	p
Intercept		14.0819		0.24905		56.5		< .001
WEIGHT		0.0232		0.00137		16.9		< .001
From this information, what is the estimate of the b0 value?

We fit the regression of Weight on Wrist (with weight as the explanatory variable).
The following results were obtained:


Model Coefficients - WRIST
Predictor	Estimate	SE	t	p
Intercept		14.0819		0.24905		56.5		< .001
WEIGHT		0.0232		0.00137		16.9		< .001
Based on a confidence level of 95%, there evidence that the slope coefficient is different from 0.

  True

The following results were obtained:


Model Coefficients - WRIST
Predictor	Estimate	SE	t	p
Intercept		14.0819		0.24905		56.5		< .001
WEIGHT		0.0232		0.00137		16.9		< .001
The coefficient of determination (r^2) is reported as 0.533.
Which of the following is the best interpretation of this coefficient?

  The proportion of variability in the size of the wrist explained by the linear model on weight is 53.3%
