## 7.3 WORKSHEET
Question 1
1 / 1 pts
Two drugs were being compared for effectiveness in a randomized control trial.  Participants for both groups were
selected so that each had a BMI of 32 and age of 35 years old at the beginning of the trial.
The diets were strictly enforced to be equal and each participant was allowed to exercise 30 minutes per day during the 12 week
trial period.  Each trial began with 50 participants

For the 43 people in drug A's group, the average weight loss was 12.3 lbs with a sample standard deviation of 4.2 lbs.
In group B the 41 who finished the trial ended up with an average weight loss of 11.4 lbs and a standard deviation of 3.2 lbs.

State the alternative hypothesis for this experiment.

  Sigma must be known

Report the degrees of freedom as calculated by the calculator for this test.
(Remember, there are 3 ways of calculating this.  Your textbook uses one, JAMOVI uses another, and only the TI 83/84 uses the correct one.)

df=(s21n1+s22n2)21n1−1(s21n1)2+1n2−1(s22n2)2

The drug company producing drug A claims victory with an add campaign saying:
"In clinical trials, our patients lost more weight than our competitor."

Is this claim accurate at the 92% level of confidence?


  No
