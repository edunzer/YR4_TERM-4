## 7.2 WORKSHEET

Question 1
1 / 1 pts
Heterosexual couples were selected for an experiment to consider levels of cholesterol (in mg/dL)  The assumption is that, as a couple,
they should have somewhat similar cholesterol due to similar diet and activity levels.  This researcher wants to determine whether or not
effects that elevate cholesterol affect males more than their female partners.  The data is as follows:

Husband	Wife
200	232
225	190
235	250
190	178
185	210
182	190
175	165
152	150
254	223
216	149
182	150
214	120
212	184
The null hypothesis for this test is:

  μdiff=0

Select all assumptions necessary to test this hypothesis


  Independent random sampling between columns
  the data for each column must be relatively normally distributed

Report your findings from the test at a 95% level of confidence

  With p <α, there is sufficient evidence to support the hypothesis that the average difference is greater than 0 at a 95% level of confidence.

Did you check the assumptions?

Try looking at the problem after removing the problem...

What's the p-value now?
