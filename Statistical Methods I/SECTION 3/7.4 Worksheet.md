IncorrectQuestion 1
0 / 1 pts
An experimenter needs to determine a sample size for their experiment. (One sample against a proposed mean)
They want an 80% power and need to achieve 95% confidence in the study
on a two tailed test.  The experimenter expects a standard deviation of about 10
on the experiment, and a scientifically important difference is at 2.5.
Using Cohen's d for effect size, what sample size should be used?

on the experiment, and a scientifically important difference is at 2.5.

The student's adviser claims that the sample size can be calculated just using the equation ME=z⋅sn√

In this case, the acceptable margin of error is 2.5 and the adviser claims that z* = 2 standard deviations is sufficient.
Using the s=10 estimate, what n value would this procedure obtain?

They want an 80% power and need to achieve 95% confidence in the study
on a two tailed test. The experimenter expects a standard deviation of about 10
on the experiment, and a scientifically important difference is at 2.5.

Using the sample size estimate from the previous equation and JAMOVI,
what is the achieved power for this experiment?

How do we interpret statistical power?
  In an experiment of the given size, the probability of detecting a difference at least as small as the effect size is...
  The probability that we fail to reject a true null hypothesis
  The rate at which we falsely reject the null hypothesis
  The rate at which we get the right answer
