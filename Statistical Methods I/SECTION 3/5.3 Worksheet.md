## 5.3 WORKSHEET

Statistics can sometimes (with a large enough sample size) detect differences that
make little difference in reality and other times fail to see things that are highly important.
The term we use for the determination of a size that is scientifically important is:

effect size

Flag question: Question 2
Question 21 pts
If a sample is too small, the statistical test may not be able to detect important difference in
the data.  We call this a lack of

power

Flag question: Question 3
Question 31 pts
In hypothesis testing, we test the statistic.

False

Flag question: Question 4
Question 41 pts
A two tailed alternative test is used when we are looking to detect a difference, while

Group of answer choices

True


Flag question: Question 5
Question 51 pts
A p-value is best described as:
Group of answer choices


the probability of observing a result at least as extreeme as we did by random chance if the null is true


Flag question: Question 6
Question 61 pts
When the p-value is small, it proves the alternative is true
Group of answer choices



False

Flag question: Question 7
Question 71 pts
A small p-value enables us to reject the null hypothesis.
Group of answer choices

True


Flag question: Question 8
Question 81 pts
Being able to find statistical significance may not show that our scientific hypothesis is true, but
failing to find statistical significance means that it was false.
Group of answer choices

False
