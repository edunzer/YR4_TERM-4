Question 1
3 / 4 pts
Why do we apply random sampling and assignment in statistical experiments?  (Please explain the effect of randomization on both the variability and bias.)
Your Answer:
Using both random sampling and assignment will enable the fundamental part of the experiment to ensure that the differences between participants/items are just parts of the experiment and not a confounding variable/'s. This helps to block possible biases that can be places on the experiment by picking and choosing variables that effect the overall outcome.

What happens to variability?

Question 2
1 / 1 pts
A farmer wants to know what the optimal nitrogen concentration is within the soil for producing certain root vegetables.  In order to do so,
he made plots including three levels of Nitrate (A, B, and C).  In addition, a number of other variables were included in the study in order
to zero in on the impact of nitrates.  An excerpt of the data is included in the table below.
Plot Number	Nitrogen Level	Sun Exposure	Water	Pesticide	Soil Porosity	Fertilizer	Vegetable Yield
1	a	Low	Low	No	0.25	Agricultural	5.2
2	b	Low	Low	No	0.3	Agricultural	5.5
3	c	Low	Low	No	0.42	Agricultural	4.8

For what reason would variables like soil porosity and sun exposure be included in this study?

Your Answer:
Those variables would be included because they are factors that can change the overall outcome of the experiment and have an effect on the response variable. This then changes the outcome that arises from the explanatory variable.

Question 6
2 / 2 pts
A researcher wants to know whether or not political opinions between conservatives and liberals differ on the state policies used in order to mitigate the impact of an epidemic.  He also feels that there may be differences of opinions between different ethnic groups within the state, so he first groups the individuals by ethnicity and then proceeded to randomly select people within each ethnicity to sample.  Individuals are asked to self identify as liberal or conservative and then asked whether they believe the state policies are positive or negative on issues like the economy, health outcomes, and constitutional compliance.
This sampling strategy is best described as ...

BarPlot for Data 3
The graph above is a side-by-side boxplot of the previous questions.  When comparing the heights of the bars, it looks like interest at the "moderate" level is almost exaclty in both genders.
What is the danger of making a comparison like this based on the format of the graph above?

There is no easy way to see the total amount of participants in either of the independent groups or the individual counts of each interest level.


Question 18

Extra Credit Question:
Define cluster sampling and provide an example of a situation where it would be the best sampling strategy.
Your Answer:
Cluster sampling is where you divide a large population into different groups or clusters. Then inside those groups random sampling takes place in order to achieve a balanced population of random sampling. An example of this could be you want to take a survey of a certain area where all demographics of the population are included. Clustering would be needed so that you ensure that you get people from each of those demographics but then still achieve the random sample of people with those demographics.

Nope. That's stratification.
