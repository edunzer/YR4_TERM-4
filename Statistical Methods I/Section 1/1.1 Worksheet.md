## 1.1 WORKSHEET


Question 1
1 / 1 pts
Researchers are investigating how much news coverage of a certain event impacts public opinions of the importance of that event.  For one particular event, two different stations are covering the event in significantly different amounts.  Channel X spends a significant portion of their time on the event while Channel Y spends very little time covering it.  Individuals, chosen with a simple random sample, are asked which news channel they watch and whether they think the event is "highly important" or not.  (This is part of a followup study where individuals were already asked this question once, but for this, we will only consider the post-event analysis.)

Results are as follows:

Importance
High	Low	Total
Channel	News X	31	14	45
News Y	18	12	30
Total	49	26	75
What proportion of respondents who watch News X found the topic to be of high importance?  (answer to 3 decimals)

Correct!
0.689
Correct Answers
0.6889 (with margin: 0.015)
