Flag question: Question 5
Question 53 pts
In a statistical experiment, we roll two die (6 sided each)
and add the results.

The outcomes of interest for our experiment are:
A = the number is odd but not prime
B = the number is prime
C = The number is even but not prime
(1 is not a prime number).   Fill in the missing values to describe this distribution:
Enter answers as a fraction in lowest terms.


Outcome	A	B	C
