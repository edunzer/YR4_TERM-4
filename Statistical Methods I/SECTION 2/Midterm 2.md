Question 5

Suppose a sample is taken of high school graduates.  74% of the individuals report cheating in high school at least once (event A).  28% report having a GPA of above 3.5 (Event B) and 18% report both having cheated and having an honors (3.5 or above) GPA.
(This is the same as the venn diagram above)

Are the events A and B independent?  Provide reasoning.

Your Answer:
they are independent since P(A) is not equal to P(A|B)

That indicates that they are NOT independent.

Question 6

Suppose a sample is taken of high school graduates.  74% of the individuals report cheating in high school at least once (event A).  28% report having a GPA of above 3.5 (Event B) and 18% report both having cheated and having an honors (3.5 or above) GPA.
(This is the same as the venn diagram above)

Define Mutually exclusive and determine if the events A and B as described are mutually exclusive or not.

Your Answer:
Mutually exclusive means that you can do them at the same time. So yes events A and B are mutually exclusive since you can cheat and have a 3.5 or above gpa. This is also evident by the .18 of people in the overlap.

It means that you CANT do them at the same time.
