0.3% of a country has a certain disease.  The test for the disease has a sensitivity of 92% (i.e., of those we know have the disease, the test comes back
positive 92% of the time.)  It has a specificity of 96%  (i.e., of those who do NOT have the disease, the test comes back negative 96% of the time.)

Determine the ACCURACY of this test (round to 5 decimals)

Remember, ACCURACY is correct values (i.e. true positives + true negatives)

0.3% of a country has a certain disease.  The test for the disease has a sensitivity of 92% (i.e., of those we know have the disease, the test comes back
positive 92% of the time.)  It has a specificity of 96%  (i.e., of those who do NOT have the disease, the test comes back negative 96% of the time.)

What proportion of tests that come back positive are actually false positives for this disease?
Again, round to 5 decimals.
