Group of answer choices


False

Flag question: Question 3
Suppose we have a bowl with identical slips of paper.  You are to select 1 piece at random and check
the number written on it.  The numbers are as follows.

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17}

Let A be the event that a number is even.
2, 6, 12, 14, 16

Let B be the event that a number is less than 11
2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9

Determine:  P(A)         (report as a fraction, not a decimal)

5/11


Flag question: Question 4
Suppose we have a bowl with identical slips of paper. You are to select 1 piece at random and check
the number written on it. The numbers are as follows.

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17}

Let A be the event that a number is even.
Let B be the event that a number is less than 11

Determine: P(A∩B) (report as a fraction, not a decimal)

2/11

Flag question: Question 5
Suppose we have a bowl with identical slips of paper. You are to select 1 piece at random and check
the number written on it. The numbers are as follows.

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17}

Let A be the event that a number is even.
Let B be the event that a number is less than 11

Determine: P(A∪B) (report as a fraction, not a decimal)

9/11


Flag question: Question 6
Suppose we have a bowl with identical slips of paper. You are to select 1 piece at random and check
the number written on it. The numbers are as follows.

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17}

Let A be the event that a number is even.
Let B be the event that a number is less than 11

Determine: P(Ac) (report as a fraction, not a decimal)

6/11


Flag question: Question 7
Suppose we have a bowl with identical slips of paper.

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17}

Let A be the event that a number is even.
2, 6, 12, 14, 16

Let B be the event that a number is less than 11
2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9

This time, I draw a slip of paper from the bowl and look at the number.  I tell you that it is even (i.e. event A).
Now what is your probability of event B also being true?  (again as a fraction)

2/5

Flag question: Question 8
Suppose we have a bowl with identical slips of paper. You are to select 1 piece at random and check
the number written on it. The numbers are as follows.

S = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 14, 16, 17}

Let A be the event that a number is even.
Let B be the event that a number is less than 11

Determine P(A and B) as well as P(A)*P(B)

If these two things are equal then the events are independent.
If they are different, then the two events are associated.
These events are...

Group of answer choices

Associated


Flag question: Question 9
If two events are disjoint (i.e. there is no overlap in outcomes on the Venn Diagram), then they are independent.
Group of answer choices


False
